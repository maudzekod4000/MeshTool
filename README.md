# MeshTool
A tool for analysing and calculating data about meshes.

![Demo - 25 MB GIF, so give it some time](https://github.com/pancanin/MeshTool/blob/main/MeshTool/demo/mesh-tool.gif)

## Precompiled executables (no build step needed)

Currently I have releases just for windows build on Intel x64. Check the 'releases' folder.

## Instalation

All libraries are included in the project folder, so no additional setup is required on your machine.

## Build

- Tested on Windows 8.1 On Intel x64 Build with Windows SDK 10, C++ 14 and Visual Studio 2019 (v142)
- Tested on Windows 10 On Intel x64 Build with Windows SDK 10, C++ 14 and Visual Studio 2022 (v143)

## Notes to the reviewer

For visualisation purposes, I have added code from my OpenGL game engine, so the code in 'src/graphics' was not written
during the 7 day period of the task.
